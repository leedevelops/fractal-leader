**COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI - All Three Fixes:**

Transform my matrix page into an interactive, gamified experience with integrated AI chat and fix navigation inconsistencies across components.

**PART 1: MATRIX PAGE REDESIGN (Primary Focus)**

Replace the static matrix layout with progressive revelation using this 27-chapter data structure:

```javascript
const chapterData = [
  { ch: 1, book: 1, hebrew: "י", bookName: "Becoming Rooted", title: "Leadership Begins at the Altar", geometry: "Square", stone: "Sardius", element: "Fire", temple: "Altar", color: "Red", direction: null },
  { ch: 5, book: 1, hebrew: "י", bookName: "Becoming Rooted", title: "The Seed Hidden in the Dust", geometry: "Monad Unity Point", direction: "North" },
  { ch: 10, book: 2, hebrew: "ה", bookName: "Becoming Aligned", title: "The Invisible Root System", direction: "South" },
  { ch: 15, book: 3, hebrew: "ו", bookName: "Becoming Clear", title: "Sacred Sight", direction: "East" },
  { ch: 20, book: 4, hebrew: "ה", bookName: "Becoming Embodied", title: "The Body of Christ", direction: "West" },
  { ch: 25, book: 5, hebrew: "ישוע", bookName: "Pattern Manifesto", title: "The Commissioning Pattern", direction: "Center" }
  // ... include all 27 chapters with full data
];
```

**Interactive Features:**
1. **Central YHWH Hub** - Clickable quadrants that reveal book chapters progressively
2. **Achievement System** - Track progress through 7 dimensions (Glory, Presence, Voice, Word, Image, Spirit, Name)
3. **Directional Compass** - North/South/East/West/Center navigation based on hidden chapters
4. **Chapter Unlock Mechanics** - Start with Chapter 1, unlock others through engagement
5. **Visual Elements** - Geometry icons, element colors, temple space indicators

**PART 2: CHAT INTEGRATION INTO MATRIX**

Add AI coaching context for each matrix element:

```tsx
// Add chat prompt buttons to each chapter card
<div className="chapter-card" onClick={() => setActiveChapter(chapter)}>
  <div className="chapter-content">{/* existing content */}</div>
  <Button 
    variant="outline" 
    size="sm"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      openChapterChat(chapter);
    }}
  >
    Ask AI Coach
  </Button>
</div>

// Chat modal or sidebar with chapter context
const openChapterChat = (chapter) => {
  setChatContext({
    chapterTitle: chapter.title,
    bookTheme: chapter.bookName,
    element: chapter.element,
    templeSpace: chapter.temple,
    spiritualFocus: chapter.dimension
  });
  setShowChat(true);
};
```

**PART 3: NAVIGATION FIXES**

Fix inconsistent routing patterns in both matrix and chat components:

```tsx
// REPLACE ALL INSTANCES OF:
window.location.href = "/api/login"
onClick={() => window.location.href = '/path'}

// WITH CONSISTENT WOUTER NAVIGATION:
import { useLocation } from "wouter";
const [, setLocation] = useLocation();
onClick={() => setLocation('/assessment')}

// For authentication, handle differently:
const handleAuth = () => {
  // Call your auth API or redirect appropriately
  // Don't use window.location.href for client-side routes
};
```

**SPECIFIC FIXES:**
- Matrix page: Fix `/api/login` redirects to use proper auth flow
- Chat component: Replace `window.location.href` with `setLocation()`
- All navigation buttons: Use Wouter's `setLocation()` consistently
- Add missing routes in App.tsx Router for `/matrix` if needed

**RESULT:** 
An immersive matrix navigation experience with contextual AI coaching, achievement tracking, and consistent routing throughout the application. Users progressively unlock the 27-chapter framework while getting personalized biblical leadership guidance.
